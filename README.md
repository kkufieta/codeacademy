# Codeacademy
I enjoy using codeacademy for the ease of reviewing and learning languages, tools, and frameworks in a fun and gamelike way.

It is not intuitive to navigate the website and to find the code I've written, 
and there are a few projects I enjoyed working on and that I'd like to keep around for future reference and idea collection.
